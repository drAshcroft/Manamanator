program is mostly just a framework at this point., but it still can be
used to edit movies. &nbsp;The cut, copy, move and encode functions
work well. &nbsp;If you wish to import more movie formats (mov, flv...)
You should download and install <br><br><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=53761&amp;filename=ffdshow-20020617.exe&amp;a=10479968" target="_blank">ffdshow</a><br><br>The
name is a little odd: It referes to Mana Mana from the muppets. &nbsp;I
originally built this video editor to help me play with my daughters
who wanted to make <br>their own Mana Mana video. &nbsp;The name is
&nbsp;the Mana Mana Editor -&gt; Manamanator. &nbsp;I will probably
change the name sometime, but not today.<br><h2>To edit a movie:</h2><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Create a new project.</span><br>&nbsp;<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 369px; height: 223px;" alt="" src="NewProject.bmp"><br>Enter
all the needed data into the next page. &nbsp;Most of the data will be
automatically sensed, but your desired framerate and framesize are
important to the editing process.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. &nbsp;Import Media files:</span><br><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 344px; height: 296px;" alt="" src="ImportFiles.bmp"><br>Load
all the media files that you desire into the project. &nbsp;It is wise
to save your project at this point. &nbsp;The program can handle any
media format that has a registered codec on the system, or that ffdshow
supports, if you are using ffdshow.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Drag Files to timeline editor:</span><br><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 240px; height: 286px;" alt="" src="DragDrop.bmp"><br>Drag
the desired file from the project file explorer to timeline editor.
&nbsp;Here you can cut, copy, move and arrange the media as desired.
&nbsp;When you have everything set up as desired press play on the
viewer to begin.<br><br>You should remember that the manamanator always selects the clip that is highest in the timeline editor to pull frames. &nbsp;<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 630px; height: 119px;" alt="" src="PlayOrder.bmp"><br>This image shows the way that the clips will be played. &nbsp;A similar path will be followed for the audio effects. &nbsp;<br><br>4. &nbsp;Export finished video:<br><br>When
the video plays like you wish in the viewer, you can export the
finished video. &nbsp;This is done by clicking File and then Export
Video. &nbsp;Select the output folder and filename, &nbsp;select the
output format and click export. &nbsp;</body></html>
